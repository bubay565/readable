# Readable
Readable is an anonymous blogging application. Users can create, vote, edit and delete posts and perform those same actions for Comments
on each post. There is a provided Node backend server to facilitate the functionality of this application

## Installation:
This project was created using create-react-app via Yarn. Simply clone/download the repository and navigate to the directory via command line.
Then execute `yarn install` to install the project dependencies.

For the server, clone/download the following repository `https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter`

## Launch Application
Execute `node server.js start` to launch the server then...

Execute `yarn start` to launch the application in a second command line window

Note: You need the server running for the application to function optimally

## Issues
The UI/UX experience of this application can be described as horrible at best at the moment. I intend to come back to this at a later time,
implementing a proper UI with Material UI. At the moment, I have focussed solely on functionality and it works as expected.

## Contribution:
This is a personal demo project however pull requests are welcome.

## Licence
Readable is public domain work. Feel free to do with it as you wish.
